## 3D reconstruction based on RGBD camera
1. using gpu to speedup, as the massive pointcloud and pixels
2. be aware of dynamic objects
 
## Image process
### bilateral filtering of depth image 


### compute vertex map from depth image, i.e. point cloud

### compute normal map from vertex map

## ICP


## Speed test
- timmer
